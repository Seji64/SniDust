  # 1. if mmdb is not loaded or not available, it's fail-open (allow by default)
  # 2. if the IP can't be resolved to a country, it's rejected
  # 3. if the country is in the blocked list, it's rejected
  # 4. if the country is in the allowed list, it's allowed
  # note that the reject list is checked first and takes priority over the allow list
  # if the IP's country doesn't match any of the above, it's allowed if the blocked list is not empty
  # for example, if the blockedlist is [US] and the allowedlist is empty, a connection from
  # CA will be allowed. but if blockedlist is empty and allowedlist is [US], a connection from
  # CA will be rejected.
